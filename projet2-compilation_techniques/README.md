# Project 2 - Compilation techniques for database systems

## Goal of the project
The specification is given in [p2.pdf](p2.pdf).<br>
This project is mainly about giving a taste and basic understanding of compilation and high-level
programming techniques such as multi-stage programming to achieve better query execution performance.<br>
This is done by implementing a **column-store lowering**, as opposed to the classic row-store.

## API
This project relies on the SC API, given at [sc-public](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-public).
