# Project 3 - Optimistic Multi-version Concurrency control

## Goal of the project
In this project, the goal is to implement a (main-memory) data store with optimistic multi-version
concurrency control (OMVCC). The objects stored in this key-value store are `(int, int)` key-value pairs.<br>

It combines the standard MVCC (multi-version CC) and OCC (optimistic CC).<br>
The full spec can be found in [p3.pdf](p3.pdf).
